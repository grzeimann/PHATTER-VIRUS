# PHATTER-VIRUS

## Background
All VIRUS data are tarred by observation.  This makes it laborious to inspect each file.  We want to do this as few times as possible, so the script "get_observation_table.py" was built.  There are a few arguments for the script:

```
usage: get_observation_table.py [-h] [-sd START_DATE] [-ed END_DATE]
                                output_file

positional arguments:
  output_file           name of the output file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -sd START_DATE, --start_date START_DATE
                        Start Date, e.g., 20170321, YYYYMMDD
  -ed END_DATE, --end_date END_DATE
                        Start Date, e.g., 20170326, YYYYMMDD
```

Our observations for M33 took place on 12/16/2022 through 01/21/2023.  The following call will be sufficient to gather metadata about each observation over that date range:

```
 python get_observation_table.py test.dat -sd 20221215 -ed 20230122
```

The table includes four columns: 'Exposure', 'Description', 'Date', 'Temp'

We can use the columns to identify our observations which all include "M33" in the name.  We can also use the columns to identify all HETDEX observations close in time that can provide sky estimates.  The table can be read in simply with:

```
from astropy.table import Table

T = Table.read(FILENAME, format='ascii.fixed_width_two_line')
```

## Task List
- [ ] Build observation table as reference
- [ ] Find M33 observations in the table
- [ ] Find DEX observations near in time
