# PHATTER-VIRUS

## Reduction Script
The reduction script starts with a table of observations over the date range of our data, finds our targeted shots, matches the shots with calibration exposures, reduces all of the relevant exposures, and writes the output to an h5 file.  

We discussed earlier finding appropriate sky exposures for our data, and we'll want to include that again in our script.  This is as simple as including lines in the for loop like this:

```
sky_obs = find_calibration_exposures(T[sciind], T, cal='dex', time_constraint=12.)
sky_list = []
for skyo in sky_obs:
    sky_list.append(reduce(skyo, h5table, basepath=basedir, ifuslots=ifuslots))
```
Get sky exposure

Pool the loop

Write output

Test the script

Inspect output

```
 python do_reductions.py test.dat 
```
