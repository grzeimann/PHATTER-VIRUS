# PHATTER-VIRUS

## Reduction Script
The reduction script starts with a table of observations over the date range of our data, finds our targeted shots, matches the shots with calibration exposures, reduces all of the relevant exposures, and writes the output to an h5 file.  

We discussed earlier finding appropriate sky exposures for our data, and we'll want to include that again in our script.  This is as simple as including lines in the for loop like this:

```
sky_obs = find_calibration_exposures(T[sciind], T, cal='dex', time_constraint=12.)
sky_list = []
for skyo in sky_obs:
    sky_list.append(reduce(skyo, h5table, basepath=basedir, ifuslots=ifuslots))
```

Then, we'll want to get the "for" loop into a function that we can call with multiprocessing.Pool.  This will have a structure like this:

```
P = Pool(16)
res = P.map(FUNCTION_NAME, sci_unique_inds)
P.close()
```

Finally, we'll want to build a function to write the output to a h5 file.  I can create the template for this when you get to this step.
